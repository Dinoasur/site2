<h1>About</h1>

<head><title>Jayla Wyandon Goals and Objectives</title></head>
<p>Through taking part in Northwestern State Universityâ€™s CIS program I was able to gain skills in coding, for example I am able to code programs and websites. In programming, my main skills in code are html, CSS, and JavaScript because these are the types of coding languages that are used for web design, which is my concentration in college.
 The coding languages used for website I know the most about are html and JavaScript. Another coding language I know is java, which is not used in web design, but I am still able to code in this language. To code in java, I know how to navigate the program eclipse, which is where programs like user interfaces can be coded and designed.
 To code in html, CSS, and JavaScript, I use the program notepad++, and I am able to design themes for websites and upload any information onto these websites. I am learning how to use android studio currently, which is used to design apps.
</p>
<p>
I know how to use several Microsoft programs, and I am certified in Word and Excel. When taking classes about databases, I have learned how to build databases in Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Access, and code databases onto a SQL server, where information is stored for each section of a database.
 Classes in network and management has also allowed me to learn how to use Microsoft project, where I can design a schedule and assign tasks based on dates over a time period.
